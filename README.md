# Pentago With Aider

This repository contains a simple implementation of the game Pentago, created with the [Aider](https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider) tool and GPT-3.5-turbo.

## Motivation

This project serves as a hands-on exploration of Aider’s capabilities in AI-assisted code generation. Aider provides an AI chat interface for coding, allowing users to request functionality changes and manage a codebase with the help of a large language model (LLM). Through its context management system, Aider can scale its focus from an overview of the entire repository to specific code files when needed, enabling efficient navigation and refactoring of larger projects.

The goal was to test how Aider handles iterative development, specifically its ability to add features and refactor code over multiple iterations. Pentago was chosen for its simple but strategic gameplay, which provided a straightforward foundation for gradual feature additions. The resulting source code is included in this repository, although functionality may be limited.

## Approach

The Pentago game involves players aiming to align five marbles on a 6x6 grid, with the added twist of rotating one of four board quadrants each turn. This setup allowed for a structured approach to feature requests and code improvements:

1. **Basic Game Mechanics**: Initially, a simple game structure was implemented without quadrant spinning.
2. **Introducing Quadrant Rotation**: Aider was then prompted to add functionality for rotating quadrants as part of player turns.
3. **User Interface Adjustments**: The interface was adjusted to allow players to interact with the rotation mechanic.
4. **Code Review and Refactoring**: Aider was prompted to analyze whether the code met the single-responsibility principle and asked to refactor.
5. **Unit Tests**: Asked to create unit tests for code created so far, troubleshoot bugs found, and review the resulting test case coverage.
6. **Refactoring to Add AI Player**: Asked Aider to refactor the code with a Player abstraction ahead of allowing for an AI player implementation. 
6. **Bug Fixes and Refactoring**: As the codebase grew, additional requests were made to refactor the code to accommodate different types of players, such as human or AI-controlled, and to fix emerging bugs.

An excerpt of the interaction between the prompts, Aider, and GPT-3.5-turbo is included below to illustrate the initial steps in development and the tool’s capabilities in managing iterative changes.

## Conclusion and Future Considerations

As the codebase became more complex, GPT-3.5-turbo struggled to keep up with Aider’s requests, particularly with managing multiple player types and ensuring code stability. Continued progress would have required smaller, more targeted iterations with increased manual testing and debugging.

In future experiments, using a more advanced coding model may yield better results in managing complex refactors and producing stable code. This experience highlights the potential and current limitations of LLM-assisted development, particularly for projects that grow beyond simple implementations.

## Aider Chat History Excerpt

Aider convieniently logs all of its chat history. Here I include some of it to show the progression of what it was able to do and where it struggled.

#### Create the game "Pentago". This is a two player game where players take turns placing marbles of their own color on a 6 by 6 grid. The player who places 5 marbles of their color contiguously wins the game. The winning placement of five marbles can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.  

To create the game "Pentago", I will provide you with the Python code for a simple text-based version of the game. This code will include the game logic, board representation, and the main game loop where two players can take turns placing their marbles and checking for a win.

This code defines a `Pentago` class with methods to initialize the game board, switch players, place marbles, check for a winner, and print the board. The `main` function runs the game loop, allowing players to input their moves and checking for a win after each turn. The game continues until a player wins by placing five of their marbles in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### Would you please re-write this in Java? And could you include a simple graphical user interface?  

To create the game "Pentago" in Java with a simple graphical user interface, I will provide you with the Java code for the game logic and the GUI using Swing. The code will include a `Pentago` class for the game logic, a `PentagoGUI` class for the user interface, and a `Main` class to run the game.

These diffs create two new Java files: `Pentago.java` for the game logic and `PentagoGUI.java` for the graphical user interface. The `Pentago` class manages the game state, and the `PentagoGUI` class creates a window with a 6x6 grid of buttons for the players to interact with. When a button is clicked, the corresponding move is made on the game board, and the game state is updated. If a player wins, a dialog is shown announcing the winner, and the application exits.

> Commit b23ad35 aider: Create the game "Pentago" with game logic and a graphical user interface in Java.  

#### Modify the game to split the board into four equal quadrants. On each turn, players must rotate one of the quadrants 90 degrees clockwise or counter clockwise. If the resulting board has 5 or more marbles of one player in a row, then that player wins the game.  

To implement the new game rules, I will modify both `Pentago.java` and `PentagoGUI.java`. The `Pentago` class will need methods to rotate quadrants and an updated `checkWinner` method. The `PentagoGUI` class will need a way for the user to select a quadrant to rotate and the direction of rotation.

Here are the diffs for the required changes:

#### Would you please implement the user dialogs to select quadrants and rotation direction? Users should be prompted immediately after placing a marble.  

To implement the user dialogs for selecting quadrants and rotation direction, I will modify the `PentagoGUI.java` file. The dialogs will be shown immediately after a player places a marble, and before the board is rotated.

These changes will prompt the user with dialogs to select the quadrant and rotation direction immediately after placing a marble. The dialogs are implemented using `JOptionPane.showOptionDialog`. The `invokeLater` method is used to ensure that the dialogs are displayed on the Event Dispatch Thread, which is the correct way to show dialogs in a Swing application.

#### There seems to be a bug. When I select rotate the lower right quadrant, the upper right quadrant is rotated. Can you fix it?  

It appears there is an issue with the quadrant selection logic in the `rotateQuadrant` method of the `Pentago` class. The row and column offsets need to be adjusted to correctly identify the lower right quadrant. Here are the diffs to fix the bug:

#### The GUI allows the user to place multiple marbles in a row. It should prompt to rotate the board immediately after placing a marble. Can you update it?  

To ensure that the GUI prompts the user to rotate the board immediately after placing a marble, I will update the `ButtonListener` class within the `PentagoGUI.java` file. The rotation prompt will be included in the `actionPerformed` method right after a marble is successfully placed.

Here are the diffs for the necessary changes:

         }
     }
 }

This change ensures that after a player places a marble, the GUI will immediately prompt for quadrant selection and rotation direction. After the rotation is performed, the board is updated, and the current player is switched. It also checks for a winner again after the rotation, in case the rotation resulted in a winning condition.

This edit block will replace the placeholder comment with the actual implementation of the rotation prompt. After a marble is placed, the user will be prompted to select a quadrant and rotation direction. The board will then be updated, the current player will be switched, and the game will check for a winner again after the rotation.

#### I'm getting errors from javac when building PentagoGUI.java: PentagoGUI.java:123: error: non-static variable selectedQuadrant cannot be referenced from a static context  
####         selectedQuadrant = getUserQuadrantSelection();  
####         ^  
#### ...
#### 9 errors  

The errors you're encountering are due to attempting to access non-static variables and methods from a static context, which is not allowed in Java. The `main` method is static and therefore cannot directly access instance variables or instance methods of the class. To fix this, you need to create an instance of `PentagoGUI` and then use that instance to call the methods. Here's the diff to correct the errors:

```diff
--- PentagoGUI.java
+++ PentagoGUI.java
@@ ... @@
 public static void main(String[] args) {
     SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
         public void run() {

-    rotateClockwise = getUserRotationDirection();
-    game.rotateQuadrant(selectedQuadrant, rotateClockwise);
-    updateBoard();

 }
```

This change will ensure that the `main` method correctly instantiates the `PentagoGUI` class and does not attempt to call non-static methods or access non-static variables. The removed lines are not necessary because the `PentagoGUI` constructor already sets up the game and the GUI.

I apologize for the confusion. Let's try again with a correct diff that applies cleanly to the current contents of `PentagoGUI.java`. We will update the `ButtonListener` class's `actionPerformed` method to prompt the user to rotate a quadrant immediately after placing a marble.

> Applied edit to PentagoGUI.java  
> Commit a225512 aider: The `ButtonListener` class now prompts the user to rotate a quadrant immediately after placing a marble.  

#### There seems to be a bug. When a player places a marble and rotates the board, the original spot they selected on the board is greyed out and no longer allows the user to place a marble there, even though there is no marble there any longer because the quadrant rotated. Can you fix it?  

To fix the bug where the original spot selected on the board is greyed out and no longer allows the user to place a marble there after a quadrant rotation, we need to update the `updateBoard` method in `PentagoGUI.java`. This method should enable buttons that do not have a marble placed on them after the board is updated.

Here is the diff for the required changes:

```diff
--- PentagoGUI.java
+++ PentagoGUI.java
@@ ... @@
 private void updateBoard() {
     for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
-            buttons[i][j].setText(String.valueOf(game.getMarble(i, j)));
+            char marble = game.getMarble(i, j);
+            buttons[i][j].setText(String.valueOf(marble));
+            buttons[i][j].setEnabled(marble == '.');
         }
     }
 }
```

This change will ensure that after each rotation, the buttons are correctly enabled or disabled based on whether there is a marble in their corresponding position on the board. Buttons with no marble ('.') will be enabled, allowing players to place a marble there.

> Applied edit to PentagoGUI.java  
> Commit a14aa0a aider: Fixed the bug where the original spot selected on the board was greyed out and no longer allowed the user to place a marble there after a quadrant rotation by updating the `updateBoard` method in `PentagoGUI.java`.  

#### How many different responsibilities does the Pentago class have? Does it conform to the Single Responsibility Principle?  

The `Pentago` class has several responsibilities:

1. Managing the game board state (storing the board and marbles).
2. Handling the current player and switching between players.
3. Placing marbles on the board.
4. Rotating quadrants of the board.
5. Checking for a winner.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. While the `Pentago` class's responsibilities are all related to the game logic, it could be argued that it is doing more than one thing: it's managing the game state, handling player turns, and determining the game outcome.

To better conform to the SRP, the `Pentago` class could be refactored to separate concerns. For example, one class could handle the game board state, another could manage player turns, and a third could be responsible for checking the game's win conditions. However, since the game logic is relatively simple and tightly coupled, it might be acceptable to keep these responsibilities within a single class for the sake of simplicity.

Since the `Pentago` class is marked as read-only, no changes can be proposed to refactor it at this time. If you would like to refactor the `Pentago` class to better adhere to the SRP, please let me know, and we can discuss how to proceed with the refactoring.


#### Please refactor the Pentago class to separate out the concern of the game board state  

To refactor the `Pentago` class and separate out the concern of the game board state, we will create a new class called `GameBoard` that will be responsible for managing the board state. The `Pentago` class will then use an instance of `GameBoard` to handle board-related operations.

Here are the diffs for the changes:

This diff creates a new `GameBoard` class that encapsulates the board state and operations on the board, such as placing marbles and rotating quadrants. The `Pentago` class is updated to use an instance of `GameBoard` for these operations. The rotation logic that was previously in the `rotateQuadrant` method of `Pentago` will need to be moved to the `GameBoard` class, but I have not included that logic here to keep the diff concise.

It seems that the `Pentago` class is trying to access the `board` variable as if it were a 2D array, but `board` is actually an instance of the `GameBoard` class. We need to update the `Pentago` class to use the `GameBoard` methods for accessing and modifying the game board.

This diff corrects the `Pentago` class to delegate the winner check to the `GameBoard` class. It also adds a placeholder `checkWinner` method to the `GameBoard` class, which you will need to implement according to the game rules.

The errors you're encountering are due to a duplicate `GameBoard` class definition in `Pentago.java` and missing method implementations in the `GameBoard` class. To resolve these issues, we need to remove the duplicate `GameBoard` class and ensure that the `GameBoard` class has the necessary methods that are being called from the `Pentago` class.

This diff removes the duplicate `GameBoard` class definition from `Pentago.java`. The `GameBoard` class should be defined in its own file, and it seems that it already exists based on the previous conversation. The `Pentago` class now correctly calls the methods on the `GameBoard` instance. Make sure that the `GameBoard` class is defined in a separate file and includes the `rotateQuadrant`, `placeMarble`, and `getMarble` methods. If the `GameBoard` class is not in a separate file, please let me know, and I will provide the necessary diffs to create it.

This diff adds a `checkWinner` method that checks for a winner by looking for five marbles of the same type in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a winner is found, it returns the marble type ('X' or 'O'). If there is no winner, it returns '.'. The `checkLine` helper method is used to check if all the marbles in a given line are the same and not empty.

#### There are test failures with GameBoardTest. Are these failures a problem with the code or with the test itself?  

To determine whether the test failures are due to issues with the code or the tests themselves, I need to review the test cases and the corresponding methods they are testing. Let's analyze the `GameBoardTest` class and the `GameBoard` class methods it is testing.

The `GameBoardTest` class contains the following test cases:

1. `testInitialBoardIsEmpty` - This test checks if the initial board is empty, which should pass if the `GameBoard` constructor initializes the board correctly with all '.' characters.

2. `testPlaceMarble` - This test checks if placing a marble works correctly and that it does not allow overwriting a marble that has already been placed.

3. `testRotateQuadrantClockwise` - This test checks if rotating a quadrant clockwise places the marble in the correct position.

4. `testRotateQuadrantCounterClockwise` - This test checks if rotating a quadrant counter-clockwise places the marble in the correct position.

The `GameBoard` class provides the following methods that are relevant to these tests:

- `GameBoard()` - The constructor that initializes the board.
- `placeMarble(int row, int col, char player)` - Places a marble on the board.
- `rotateQuadrant(int quadrant, boolean clockwise)` - Rotates a specified quadrant in the given direction.

If the tests are failing, there could be a mismatch between the expected behavior defined in the tests and the actual implementation in the `GameBoard` class. To resolve the issue, we need to identify the cause of the failure by examining the test output and then either fix the code or adjust the tests accordingly.

Since I don't have access to the test output, I can't directly identify the cause of the failure. However, if you provide me with the specific test failures and their output, I can help you determine whether the problem lies in the code or the tests and propose a solution.

#### FAILURES!!!  
#### Tests run: 4,  Failures: 2  

The test output indicates that the expected value for the tests `testRotateQuadrantClockwise` and `testRotateQuadrantCounterClockwise` is `88` (which is the ASCII value for 'X'), but the actual value returned by the `getMarble` method is `46` (which is the ASCII value for '.'). This suggests that the marble is not being rotated correctly within the quadrant.

The issue seems to be with the `rotateQuadrant` method in the `GameBoard` class. The tests are expecting the marble placed at position `(0, 0)` to be rotated to `(2, 0)` for a clockwise rotation and to `(0, 2)` for a counter-clockwise rotation, but this is not happening.

Let's correct the `rotateQuadrant` method in the `GameBoard` class to ensure that the rotation logic is implemented correctly. Here is the diff with the necessary changes:

#### I think the logic in the test was wrong. Now in the GUI, rotating clockwise actually rotates counter clockwise. And rotating counter clockwise rotates clockwise. I think we need to undo the change to the GameBoard class and fix the test to properly test for clockwise and counter clockwise rotation  

First, let's revert the changes made to the `rotateQuadrant` method in the `GameBoard` class within the `Pentago.java` file. Then, we will correct the unit tests in `GameBoardTest.java` to properly test for clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation.

```

And the correction for the unit tests:

The test failures indicate that the expected value `'X'` (ASCII code 88) does not match the actual value `'.'` (ASCII code 46) after the rotation. This suggests that the tests are not correctly setting up the board state before the rotation, or they are asserting the wrong positions after the rotation. Let's correct the tests to match the expected behavior of the `rotateQuadrant` method.

The test failures indicate that the expected marble positions after the rotations are not matching the actual positions. This could be due to incorrect test setup or incorrect assertions. Let's correct the tests to match the expected behavior of the `rotateQuadrant` method.

Here is the diff to update the tests in `GameBoardTest.java`:

```diff

This diff updates the `testRotateQuadrantClockwise` and `testRotateQuadrantCounterClockwise` methods to correctly place a marble and then assert its new position after the rotation. The positions are chosen based on the assumption that quadrant 1 is the top-left quadrant and the rotations are performed correctly by the `rotateQuadrant` method.

> Applied edit to GameBoardTest.java  
> Commit 573edd5 aider: Fix the test cases in `GameBoardTest.java` to correctly test the rotation of the quadrants in the `GameBoard` class.  

#### How complete are the tests in GameBoardTest.java?  

The tests in `GameBoardTest.java` are not entirely complete. They cover some basic functionality such as:

- Checking if the initial board is empty.
- Testing if a marble can be placed on the board.
- Testing the rotation of a quadrant both clockwise and counter-clockwise.

However, there are several aspects of the `GameBoard` class that are not currently tested:

1. There are no tests for the `checkWinner` method, which is a critical part of the game logic.
2. The `rotateQuadrant` method tests only cover one quadrant and one marble placement. It would be beneficial to test all quadrants and multiple marble placements to ensure the rotation logic is correct in all cases.
3. There are no tests for edge cases, such as attempting to place a marble outside the bounds of the board.
4. There are no tests for the scenario where the board is full or for a draw situation.
5. The tests do not cover scenarios where the game should not allow a move, such as placing a marble on an already occupied space (this is partially covered, but could be expanded).

To improve the test coverage, additional test cases should be written to cover these scenarios. If you would like me to implement these additional tests, please let me know, and I can provide the necessary code changes.


#### Yes, please implement the additional tests  

I will add the following tests to `GameBoardTest.java`:

1. Tests for the `checkWinner` method to ensure it correctly identifies a winner in various scenarios.
2. Additional tests for the `rotateQuadrant` method to cover all quadrants and multiple marble placements.
3. Tests for edge cases, such as attempting to place a marble outside the bounds of the board.
4. Tests for a full board and draw situations.
5. Tests for invalid moves, such as placing a marble on an already occupied space.

#### I'm thinking of adding an AI player to this game. Let's start by refactoring the code to add a Player abstraction. Then later we can implement some different AI players which use different strategies or difficulty levels.  

To start refactoring the code for adding a Player abstraction, we will first create a `Player` interface. This interface will define the methods that any type of player, human or AI, must implement. Then, we will create a `HumanPlayer` class that implements this interface. Later on, we can create different AI player classes that also implement the `Player` interface.

These changes introduce the `Player` interface and the `HumanPlayer` class, and refactor the `Pentago` class to use the new `Player` abstraction instead of a simple `char` to represent the current player. The `makeMove` method in the `HumanPlayer` class is left unimplemented for now, as it will need to interact with the user interface, which is not part of the current scope.

It seems that the `PentagoGUI` class is trying to call a method `getCurrentPlayer()` which no longer exists in the `Pentago` class after the refactoring. The method was renamed to `getCurrentPlayerMarble()`. To fix the compilation error, we need to update the `PentagoGUI` class to use the correct method name.

Please add the `PentagoGUI.java` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes to fix the compilation error.

#### Can you update HumanPlayer.java so it is interacting with the GUI in the makeMove method?  

To enable the `HumanPlayer` class to interact with the GUI, we need to pass a reference to the `PentagoGUI` to the `HumanPlayer` and then use this reference to trigger GUI interactions. However, since the `Player` interface and `HumanPlayer` class are designed to be independent of the GUI, we should not directly couple them with GUI code.

Instead, we can use a callback mechanism where the `HumanPlayer` will notify the GUI when it's time for the human player to make a move. The GUI will then handle the actual interaction with the user to get the move and place the marble on the board.

Here's how we can implement this:

1. Define a callback interface that the GUI can implement.
2. Update the `HumanPlayer` class to accept a callback and invoke it when `makeMove` is called.
3. Update the `PentagoGUI` class to implement this callback interface and handle the user interaction.

Since I don't have access to modify `PentagoGUI.java`, I will only provide the diff for `HumanPlayer.java`. You will need to update `PentagoGUI.java` accordingly.

```

You will need to implement the callback interface in `PentagoGUI` and pass a lambda or method reference to the `HumanPlayer` constructor when creating players. The callback should handle the user's move input and then call `placeMarble` on the `GameBoard`.

#### You have access to PentagoGUI.java. Would you please modify it?  

To modify `PentagoGUI.java` to work with the changes made to `HumanPlayer.java`, we need to implement a callback mechanism that will be called when the `HumanPlayer` is ready to make a move. This callback will handle the interaction with the GUI to get the move from the user.

Here's the diff for the necessary changes to `PentagoGUI.java`:

```

In the `Pentago` class constructor, we now pass a `Consumer<HumanPlayer>` callback that will be used by the `HumanPlayer` to notify the GUI when it's time to make a move. The `handleHumanPlayerMove` method enables all the buttons on the board that don't already have a marble placed on them, allowing the human player to make a move.

Please note that you will also need to update the `Pentago` class constructor to accept the `Consumer<HumanPlayer>` callback and pass it to the `HumanPlayer` constructor. Since I don't have the current state of the `Pentago` class, I cannot provide an exact diff for that change.

#### You have access to Pentago.java, please update it too  

To update `Pentago.java` to work with the changes made to `HumanPlayer.java` and `PentagoGUI.java`, we need to modify the constructor of the `Pentago` class to accept a `Consumer<HumanPlayer>` callback and pass it to the `HumanPlayer` instances when they are created. This will allow the `HumanPlayer` to notify the GUI when it's time to make a move.

Here's the diff for the necessary changes to `Pentago.java`:

```

With this change, the `Pentago` class now takes a `Consumer<HumanPlayer>` callback as a parameter in its constructor and passes it to the `HumanPlayer` instances. This allows the `HumanPlayer` to communicate with the GUI when it's their turn to make a move. The `switchPlayer` method is also updated to pass the callback when switching players.

The compilation errors you're encountering are due to the missing import statement for the `Consumer` class in `Pentago.java`. The `Consumer` class is part of the `java.util.function` package, which needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. I will provide the necessary diff to add the import statement.

Here's the diff:

#### OK, let's add an AI player. Can you think of some simple ways to implement an AI that can play this game?  

Certainly! A simple AI for a game like Pentago can be implemented using various strategies. Here are a few ideas:

1. **Random Move AI**: The AI randomly selects an empty spot on the board to place its marble and then randomly selects a quadrant to rotate in a random direction. This is the simplest form of AI and does not require any strategic thinking.

2. **Greedy AI**: The AI always tries to make a move that will give it the most immediate advantage, such as extending a line of its own marbles or blocking the opponent's potential winning line. It can also choose to rotate a quadrant that maximizes its chances of winning or disrupts the opponent's strategy.

3. **Minimax AI**: This is a more advanced strategy where the AI simulates future moves (both its own and the opponent's) and chooses the move that minimizes the maximum possible loss (hence "minimax"). This can be combined with a heuristic evaluation function to score board states.

4. **Heuristic-based AI**: The AI uses a heuristic function to evaluate the desirability of each possible move based on certain criteria, such as the number of lines it is contributing to, the potential to create forks (where two lines of marbles can be completed in one move), and the potential to block the opponent's lines.

For the purpose of this task, let's implement a simple Greedy AI that tries to either win in the next move or block the opponent from winning. It will also choose a quadrant rotation that seems most beneficial based on the current board state.

Would you like to proceed with this implementation, and if so, should I create a new `AIGreedyPlayer` class that implements the `Player` interface?


#### Sure, please implement the AIGreedyPlayer  

To implement the `AIGreedyPlayer`, I will create a new file named `AIGreedyPlayer.java` that implements the `Player` interface. The AI will evaluate the board to find the best move to either win or block the opponent from winning and then choose a quadrant to rotate.

Here's the diff for the new `AIGreedyPlayer.java` file:

This diff creates a new file for the `AIGreedyPlayer` class. The `makeMove` method currently contains a placeholder for the actual greedy strategy and simply makes a random move. The placeholders for `tryToWin`, `tryToBlockOpponent`, and `chooseBestRotation` indicate where the logic for the greedy strategy would be implemented.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the implementation of the actual greedy strategy logic, or if you have any other specific requirements for the AI player.

#### Yes, please proceed with the implementation of the actual greedy strategy logic  

To implement the actual greedy strategy logic for the `AIGreedyPlayer`, I will:

1. Implement the `tryToWin` method to check if there's a move that can lead to a win and execute it.
2. Implement the `tryToBlockOpponent` method to check if there's a move that can block the opponent from winning and execute it.
3. Implement the `chooseBestRotation` method to determine the best quadrant to rotate after placing a marble.
4. Update the `makeMove` method to use the above strategies.

Please note that the `GameBoard` class will need a `removeMarble` method to support undoing moves during the AI decision-making process. If this method is not already implemented, it will need to be added. Let me know if you would like me to provide the implementation for the `removeMarble` method as well.
